== Description ==

ESV CrossRef, once installed onto your website will scan your site for Old and New Testament Bible references. Once it finds a Bible reference on the page it will convert the reference(s) into a hover-able link! Each time a converted link is hovered over, a small pop up will appear containing the scripture reference. This plug-in is designed to include a single Javascript file into the footer.
